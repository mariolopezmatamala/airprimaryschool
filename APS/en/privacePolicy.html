                prohibited, particularly:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Publication or transmission of any content that, in Air Primary School's judgment, is violent,

            <h2>Commercial Communications</h2>
            <p>In accordance with the LSSI, Air Primary School will not send advertising or promotional communications
                via email or other equivalent electronic communication means that have not been previously requested or
                expressly authorized by the recipients.</p>
            <p>In the case of users with whom a previous contractual relationship exists, Air Primary School is
                authorized to send commercial communications regarding products or services.</p>
